Howdy Peeps,

On Tuesday, Ginkgo suggested that we discuss the 'animal' in us all—the part with impulses—and our ego—the part of us which has the notion of selfhood.\
So, this Thursday, we'll be discussing: _The [id](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/id#Noun) and the [ego](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ego#Noun). Is one perhaps more important than the other? [What does each give us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id,_ego_and_super-ego)?_
As always, we'll meet on **Thursday (8pm to 9pm ET) at Alumni Hall 200**.\
To stay in touch with the rest of the organisation, remember to [join our GroupMe](https://groupme.com/join_group/70576704/wc8yedGU), [our mailing list](https://muhub.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/hom), and [follow our Instagram](https://instagram.com/humanistsofmiami).

Regards,\
Emil
