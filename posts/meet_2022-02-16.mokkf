Hi All,

I hope your week was not too taxing. If it was, I am sure the meeting this **Thursday** will lift your spirits up. It will take place in **Alumni 200 at 8:00pm.** We will be talking about a topic very unfamiliar to, hopefully, most of us: War. We will delve deeper into the philosophy of war where questions like Is war ethical? Is everything actually fair in war? What even are war crimes? Are wars inevitable and necessary for the development of society, culture, and science? are sure to be thrown around. We encourage you to bring your own questions and angles to the discussion. For the war on war this Thursday, sharpen your minds rather than your swords and clear your throats rather than your rifles; we will be fighting with thoughts and voices instead of guns and steel. Here are some links that might help you better form your arguments:

If you want something more technical, here's a [research paper](http://ispcjournal.org/journals/2016-17/PC_vol_17-12-25.pdf) on war and peace. I will see you all on Thursday. Thanks to Aisulu for suggesting this topic.

Please join our [GroupMe](https://groupme.com/join_group/70576704/wc8yedGU) and go add us on [The Hub](https://muhub.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/hom) if you haven't already. 

Yours Truly,\
Nishan Amgain
