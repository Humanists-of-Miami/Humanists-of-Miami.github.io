All positions are up for grabs. These include:\

Event Organizer 

Now...\
*Live Laugh Love*\
Hedonism, Humor, Humanism 

This week we will talk about these three H's that are very much separate concepts, yet they intertwine in unexpected ways. Is Humanism Hedonistic? What is the role of Humor in advancing humanistic views? Is Humor Hedonistic? 

We could certainly discuss these concepts separately -- but I thought we could discover a connection between them through scrupulous intellectual digging.\
Encyclopedia entries on each concept:\
[Hedonism](https://iep.utm.edu/hedonism/)\
[Humor](https://iep.utm.edu/humor/#H2)\
[Humanism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/humanism)

Yours faithfully,\
Ice
