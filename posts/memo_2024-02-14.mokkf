Hello Humanists!

We've been invited to an event! I'll let you read about the details in Karla's email, but this looks like a really good opportunity for us to build ties with another organization (plus, snacks). If you're free on Friday March 1st at 2:30pm, please consider going! Additionally, if you do end up RSVPing, go ahead and shoot me a message so we can plot.ðŸ˜ˆ

See you tomorrow night (at 7!!!),
Sam

Hello Sam Darby,


We are reaching out because you have been identified as a leader or advisor of Humanists of Miami organization. The M.E.T.A. (Multifaith Engagement for Transformative Action) Advisory board would like to formally invite you and the members of your organization to our kick off event we are planning to host on March 1st at 2:30 PM.


Over the last semester we have been working hard on making the Ford Mediation Room a more inclusive space for all students to access. In hopes to make this a more inclusive and welcoming space we have repainted, refurnished, redecorated, and would like you to join us in unveiling the space. We will gather on Friday March 1st at 2:30 PM and refreshments will be served across the hall in the Wikiaami Room.  [Please RSVP](https://miamioh-dot-yamm-track.appspot.com/2FV-bNdnyx_dBXyWkgbrHvcZFaFlkXz=PlS-0NjWxTBkReSY-jjQGCgNrLUnsDwBK4cSEO-mwl9cVJCf4T8Lc-rG7JgDwtCXqDO9YygVfHH=s-Cv2XZvwZyt7OrPz07bGIutb1WuYdPxqoWAftksyABurnlQZgTjXAzySUELTzjRMdsSvNclMGe=OARqgbMUVs5EOd0Z). The RSVP is important so we can anticipate the amount of food needed, Additionally - please share with other students who may be interested in Interfaith work. We hope to make a connection with you and others who would be interested in collaborating with and reviving the M.E.T.A. student organization.


The Student Organization M.E.T.A. - Multifaith Engagement for Transformative Action is supported through the generous gift of the Ford Family. The Ford Family Initiative helps support programming centered around Interfaith and secular programming designed to explore and learn about ways of making meaning and spiritual practices. The Ford Family Initiative and M.E.T.A. are here to support students of different faith traditions or no faith at all as they build community through collaboration and understanding.
