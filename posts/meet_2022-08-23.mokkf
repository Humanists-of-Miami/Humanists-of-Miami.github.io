Hello Peops and Welcome back to Miami!

HOM is back on the schedule in Alumni 200 at 8 pm this Thursday. Our first meeting will be a get-together - we will share stories from the summer, discuss the benefits of the philosophical approach to life, and decide on the plans for the club.  

We will have a booth at the **Mega fair this Sunday**, so make sure to stop by there as well.\ 
See you soon, 

Truthfully Ais
