Humanists of Miami is a student organisation at Miami University.\
We're an all-inclusive, casual discussion group with no particular philosophical, political, or religious affiliation; each week, we pick a new discussion topic and attempt to explore said topic, or attempt to reach a common consensus.\
We hold weekly discussions on Thursdays, from 8pm to 9pm ET in [Alumni Hall 200](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alumni_Hall_(Miami_University)). After our meetings, we have a tradition of getting tea together as a group.\
Occasionally, we have faculty members come in to talk on various topics that we collectively find interesting.
