"content" : "Hello Humanists!Mega Fair, as I’m sure you’ve heard, is nearly upon us. Specifically, it’s 11-2 on Sunday, September 3rd (this weekend!!!). Check in begins at 10, so the plan will be to arrive around 10:30 to get set up and make sure we’re settled in when the freshmen arrive. However! We need not all be there at once. In fact, this year tabling is limited to 3 representatives per organization at once, so in order to get as many people involved as possible and prevent fatigue, we’re going to split that time up into 1 hour shifts. The more people sign up to help, the less time you’ll actually have to spend behind the table.With all that in mind, please respond to this email with your availability/how many hours you’d like to work if you’re interested in helping out. I’ll reach back out to you by Friday with a schedule for your shift/more info in general.This is our biggest recruitment event of the year! We need young blood to keep this club going and this is where we hunt for it, so please consider helping out.Hope to hear from you soon,Sam",

"content" : "Howdy Peeps,I want to congratulate Grant McCrary for his hard work during his time at Miami University–he’s been a wonderful friend to us all, and made a fantastic President during his time in that role. I wish him luck in his pursuit of becoming a labour lawyer post-graduation. Grant is available to connect with on LinkedIn.Tonight, we will be holding elections for the roles of Vice President, Secretary, Historian, and any other roles people wish to retire from. To briefly explain the roles, the Vice President alternates with the President in deciding topics &amp;amp; sending emails, and co-moderates during meetings. The Secretary takes notes during meetings and makes these available to the Historian. The Historian maintains the club website for posterity, advises the executive board on club history, procedures, and tradition, and maintains contact with members who’ve since left the university yet remain involved with the organisation. While the roles of Secretary and Historian are not essential to fill, we will make time to elect a new VP; the newly elected members enter their roles at the start of next semester.As the outgoing VP, I will remain available to advise the new VP if requested during my final semester; I frequently sought Ais’s advice when I took on this role myself.The election process will occur as it did in the past. As a reminder:It will take place over GroupMe. While we will discuss in-person, those who do not wish to attend will still be able to nominate members for roles, and vote among the candidates. If you are not present, but still wish to resign from your current position, please announce your intentions on GroupMe.A nominated member has the right to decline nomination.Once a person is nominated and has accepted nomination, we will continue to seek further candidates for a position until in-person deliberation has concluded and it is evident that no further nominations will be made. Only someone present in-person may then proceed to create a poll for a position, with every candidate nominated.As always, we’ll meet on Thursday (8pm to 9pm ET) at Alumni Hall 200.To stay in touch with the rest of the organisation, remember to join our GroupMe, our mailing list, and follow our Instagram.Kind regards,Emil",

Next Thursday (11/16) will be a very special episode of HOM. Instead of our usual topic and debate meeting, we will instead be taking turns sharing short philosophical and/or informational presentations. Among other benefits, this will give us an opportunity to explore some of the topics that don’t contain quite enough controversy for a regular meeting, but are nonetheless interesting.If you’d like to present but are having trouble picking a topic, might I suggest: what’s your hottest philosophical take? You’ll have about ten minutes to make your case uninterrupted, this is your chance to convince us. Once you’ve decided on a topic, please reach out to either Emil (sayahie@miamioh.edu) or myself (darbys@miamioh.edu) for approval and so that we can plan the order of presentation/exactly how long we can give you before yanking you off stage.At the end of the meeting, we will vote on the best, funniest, and most convincing presentations.

"content" : "Hello Humanists,By a very narrow margin in this week’s GroupMe poll, our topic for Thursday is going to be: Did the sexual revolution fail? The sexual revolution, as defined by Wikipedia, “was a social movement that challenged traditional codes of behavior related to sexuality and interpersonal relationships throughout the developed Western world from the 1960s to the 1970s.” From the feminist perspective, this heavily featured the goals of eliminating undue favorable bias towards men, ending the objectification of women, and supporting women’s right to choose their sexual partners free of outside interference or societal judgment. Other hot button topics included: contraceptives, abortion, “free love”, sadomasochism, non-monogamy, and nonmarital sex.It’s also worth mentioning that by the late 1970s and early 80s, the sexual revolution caused a considerable divide among feminists, an ideological debate that was eventually labelled the “feminist sex wars.” Broadly, feminists split into anti-porn feminist and sex-positive feminist groups divided primarily along the debates around pornography, sadomasochism, and prostitution, although all aspects of the sexual revolution became controversial between these two camps.To get you started thinking about this topic, I would suggest the following readings:The Wikipedia article concerning the sexual revolutionAn article arguing that the sexual revolution HAS failedThe Wikipedia article about the “feminist sex wars” that followed the sexual revolution (I would recommend the debates section in particular)As always, our meeting will be Thursday night at 8pm in Alumni Hall room 200.

In our first vote of the year, you the people have chosen Joe’s topic: exploring the relationship between empathy, morality, and oppression. So much of how we often teach and talk about morality is wrapped up in the notion of empathy (i.e. feeling what others feel), and yet we rarely stop to fully consider who in society gets to receive our empathy and how the implications of those limitations lead to, or, perhaps, generate systems of oppression.For more details on some of the points involved in this topic, here’s an article from Vox about some of Paul Bloom’s ideas concerning empathy (our inspiration for this topic).See y’all tomorrow in Alumni Hall room 200 at 8:00pm!Best,Samantha Darby",

If you don’t believe in the afterlife, then your time on Earth is all you have and when you leave, you will eventually be forgotten (except in the cases of extreme fame).Death (as far as we know) is permanent, irreversible, and at times devastating. Even in the event of dying a “hero’s death” such as being persecuted for a noble cause or dying in a war by trying to save someone’s life, your voice has still been taken away forever and people might only mention you for so long before moving on with their lives. So is all death undignified or does it depend? It’s that time of the semester where things can get existential and philosophical before final exams, so join us in Alumni Hall 200 @ 8:00PM TODAY to share your thoughts and unwind!All the best,Grant McCrary",

"content" : "Howdy Peeps,This Thursday, we’ll be discussing the following question: Is the practice of animal testing &amp;amp; experimentation ethical?The debate over animal experimentation dates back many years, with the first British regulation of the practice being passed as the Cruelty to Animals Act 1876, and the current primary legislation regulating the practice in the United States having been passed as the Laboratory Animal Welfare Act of 1966; while this debate may be old, I’m sure we will all have new viewpoints to share and contribute.As always, we’ll meet on Thursday (8pm to 9pm ET) at Alumni Hall 200.To stay in touch with the rest of the organisation, remember to join our GroupMe, our mailing list, and follow our Instagram.Be well, and enjoy the upcoming break!Regards,Emil",

"content" : "Spring Break is quickly approaching, so push through because we are almost there! But in the meantime, why not ponder an existential question like if humans truly have free will? This week we have a special guest lecturer, Dr. Emily Zakin from Miami’s Philosophy department coming to talk to us about that very subject. Her work on Beauvoir and “The Drama of Independence” will be key features of this presentation, but don’t worry if you are not familiar with these as everything will be explained.Please try to attend this meeting if you can, as it is important for us to build up a rapport with professors and the community, especially the philosophy department. This week, we will be meeting at 7:00 PM in Alumni Hall 200 to accommodate Dr. Zakin’s busy schedule. As a housekeeping item, if we like this time better we could hold a vote on whether we want to ultimately switch the meeting time for the future. Enjoy your week and get outside while the weather lasts!Respectfully,Grant McCrary (I will try to get the letterhead for the email like Emil does soon)P.S. This is a plug for another org I am in; we (NRHH, a service org) are desperate not only for new members, but for leaders who could serve on our exec board. This can be a great resume boost and an opportunity to build leadership skills while serving the Miami community. If you have ANY interest, please apply here (the application is not too bad and conveniently I serve on the member voting committee so as long as you follow the directions and don’t say anything offensive, you’re almost guaranteed to get in). The application closes Thursday at 5:00PM so please apply if you can or have any desire to!",

Our topic for discussion, as proposed by AJ ( I believe), will be how perceptions of beauty influence perceptions of character. There is a lot of research in social psychology suggesting that conventionally attractive people are perceived to be more competent in other areas of life; these are called the halo effect and the physical attractiveness stereotype. Do you agree that society has a bias in favor of the attractive or is this mostly hot air? Join us at Alumni Hall 200 at 8:00 PM on Thursday to share your thoughts on this topic.Wishing you a beautiful week,Grant",

This will be one of our most broad topics and you can speak about anything related to love and relationships.If you’d like a little direction with what you want to talk about, here are some ideas that may interest you: Do soulmates exist? How has pornography affected love? Does porn do more harm than good? Should love only be between humans or can we love an artificial intelligence? Recent developments actually suggest humans may be able to have sex with robots (https://scrippsnews.com/stories/sex-robots-get-more-intimate-with-humans-thanks-to-ai/), so would this be damaging to our society or is there nothing wrong with it?

Questions that I am about to ask have been asked and will be asked in the future, but we mostly ignore them because it seems to most of us that there is a clear answer. Maybe there is, but if that is the view you hold, I want us to think why these questions have a place they do amidst such (presumed) certainty. Here are the questions: Who should be allowed to vote? Should voting be made mandatory by the state? What kind of ethical burden do you bear if you do not exercise your right to vote? What kind of issues should be voted on by the masses and what kind of issues should be addressed by the “experts” in their respective fields?Some links to be more informed on the topic:https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/voting/https://aeon.co/ideas/the-right-to-vote-should-be-restricted-to-those-with-knowledgeAs always, I’ll see you in Alumni 200 @ 8pm.Best,Nishan",

"content" : "Hey y’all,This week, I propose to talk about the philosophy of identity (we will most likely talk about personal identity). The dilemma of identity is best laid out in the thought experiment called Ship of Theseus. Here’s the story:Theseus owned a ship and the ship was entirely made of wood. Every time a piece of the ship needed replacing it was replaced with a metal part. This went on for a few years until eventually it was entirely made of metal.Is the metal ship of Theseus the same ship as the wooden ship of Theseus?What happens when we apply the same notion to people? We grow and change, learn new things and forget some, our body cells replace themselves within 7-10 years (with exception of neurons) - so like the ship, are we the same person through time? Is it still the same thought experiment or does it take a vastly different shape and form?Lastly, is this question just a brain teaser or do you think it’s important? Does the question “Am I the same me as I was yesterday” bear any significance in your life?As always, we will see you on Thursday at 8 pm in ALUMNI 200.Best,Nishan",

With all the talks about banning books (fahrenheit 451 irl), integrating critical race theory or not integrating critical race theory into the US curriculum, it might be interesting to look at the philosophy behind a formal education system where the state decides what information is most vital to be fed to young minds. Viewed through that lens, one might question the ethics and morality of education. What should the role and the goal of education be? Should it be mandatory? Who should get to decide what a child should study? Wikipedia has a great entry on the subject, checking it out will give you a sense of the scope of this topic.

Alumni is between Irvin and Bishop Halls.This week our topic of discussion will be Life and Meaning. I concede the topic might sound uninspired to some but the beauty of this topic lies in the various ways it can be interpreted. One may deduce the topic as asking a straightforward question with not so straightforward answer: “What does life mean to you?” Someone may look at it differently and ponder: “Is life (intrinsically) meaningful?” Maybe some of us who are tired of the rabbit hole of metaphysical arguments and are inclined towards a more pragmatic discussion find these two words, life and meaning, central to religious, political, and personal disputes and social issues like abortion rights. You are free to interpret the words life and meaning as you please.Gleefully,Nishan - PresidentAis - Vice President",

This should be a good meeting to cover some topics that you guys really wanted us to cover but didn’t. Like always, I will see you guys this Thursday @8pm in Alumni Hall.Sincerely,Nishan",

Dr. Massie, our club advisor, is coming on March 3rd (next week) to facilitate a discussion on the topic “How to ethically allocate scarce medical resources?” So this week, our topic of discussion will be Bioethics. Some questions to think about are: Are animal trials ethical? should individuals vaccinate themselves for the society even when they are not convinced of its usefulness to themselves? Should CRISPR be used on Humans? Who should delineate these rules? The meeting will be more exciting if you guys come in prepared with some specific questions or points you want to explore.

You’re in for a treat…if you have the sweet tooth for ambiguous little philosophy-themed talk shops. We’re non-exclusive but sized as an exclusive club, so feeling right at home won’t be a problem.Carrying on the discussion about the definition of race, I propose we segway into a discussion of the meaning of identity through the thought experiment called Ship of Theseus. Here’s the story:Theseus owned a ship and the ship was entirely made of wood. Every time a piece of the ship needed replacing it was replaced with a metal part. This went on for a few years until eventually it was entirely made of metal.Is the metal ship of Theseus the same ship as the wooden ship of Theseus?The thought experiment is pertaining to the notion of personhood. We grow and change, learn new things and forget some, our body cells replace themselves within 7-10 years (with exception of neurons) - so like the ship, are we the same person through time?See you on Thursday at 8 pm in ALUMNI 200.

For its redundancy in political discussions, the climate might not be everyone’s favorite “philosophical” topic (or philosophical topic at all, for that matter). But the topic of climate change certainly concerns little things like justice and equality, which are big discussions on their own. An article from the President of Uganda that came out on Wall Street Journal recently sets a good base to talk on climate justice. To put it grossly, should developing nations pay the western world by sacrificing their industrial boom for the sake of clean energy? On the other hand, there will be no boom to have without action on climate…the article link: https://www.wsj.com/articles/solar-wind-force-poverty-on-africa-climate-change-uganda-11635092219Yes, as usual, the meeting is in Alumni 200 at 8 pm.Yours missingly,Ais",

"content" : "Ethics of Voting  Elections in 2 meetings.  There is a bit of a disconnect between Nishan’s attempts at appealing to both sides of the political spectrum and the actual political composition of the club: that is to say that we are just about all socialists.  Should only “intelligent” (i.e. educated) people be allowed to vote? In which case, how is intelligence to be determined, and how is “intelligence” to be distinguished in context? How often does public opinion (established through votes) concur with an “advantageous” position? Is the way states are represented in the Senate and House of Representatives fair? What is the function of the Senate when its modern function has been primarily to inhibit the acts of the House? Why should States be represented in federal matters, as opposed to simply reflecting the judgment of the nation as a whole?  Why might someone not vote? Not everyone feels that party alignments are valuable, or that they are sufficiently educated to meaningfully vote. Is a vote even an action with moral characteristic? Would a multi-party or no-party system improve individual voice in US policy? Party and individual power becomes watered down once politicians enter the legislative floor. A multi party system often results in one party forming a majority anyway– how effective can a multi party be?  What about the ethics of mandatory voting?",

In theory, if individuals hold each other accountable, then immoral acts may be largely neutralized through individual actions. Can standard citizens then be held accountable for the actions of their government? Can powerful individuals be held accountable for the actions of their government? Can powerful governments be held accountable for the actions of other governments?  Perhaps, but the this idea has been used to justify historical acts of imperialism. Consider the draft, consider the value of the vote in the US and other countries. Not to conflate the complexity of ethics with a call to inaction. Cold War justifications, Middle East justifications. Is there an altruistic reason to intervene abroad? Russia-Ukraine war. Should the US be obligated to intervene in other conflicts before it is able to improve itself? But individuals are not our government– why are we obligated to think in the context of borders at all? Regardless of the ideological meaning of borders, or the material purpose of borders, and how well they fit within an ideal– borders exist.

The Ship of Theseus may be said to be the same ship, not for its composition, but for its value to the people that used it and knew it. Douglas Adams’s experience with the Shinto shrine. Is identity contingent on the people with whom you interact? Who you are with your mom vs with your friends vs with your teachers etc. Tree falling in a forest etc. 2022 Physics Nobel prize as counter to theories of butterfly effect. Star Trek transporters. Buddhist conceptions of the self as a sophism.Does the self expand with age? Can aspects of the self be “lost?” When a person is lost, one loses the identity they had in their presence. Do you wish you could be someone else? Does there exist a true, singular self? Not the same as being disingenuous– just that our self concept is dependent on interactions with others. Can identity be defined?– by demographic factors? Identity is always subject to change and dependent on environment. Might there be a “core” in identity?Identity vs sense of self– morals, cognitive processes, etc distinct from identity and inarticulable. Identity may be defined through negatives, as a relative concept, while sense of self exists intrinsically. Is sense of self intrinsic, though? As even our understanding of our own cognitive processes occurs only relative to others, only with the understanding that there are others who are not like us. Does a sense of self still exist without a way to articulate it?",

Structures of knowledge as relating to philosophy of mind– “knowing animal.” Knowledge:survival as parallel to to debates of altruism. Internal knowledge of identity as distinct from universal knowledge.Knowledge is relative. “I know my address,” in the sense that when asked for my address, I may give an answer.

Words must have meaning– convey “knowledge”– for any progress or prepositions, any science to move forward. In this sense things are “true,” by virtue of their meanings. Cannot “truth” be created through the creation of words (e.g. “all blombos are flingies”)? Unless truth is maintained by collective agreement.Does any communication require the existence of axioms? “Definitions,” which may act as axioms, still vary when put down. Words change definitions over time– “meaning” is ephemeral. Meaning cannot even be communicated between individuals, regardless of to what extent they share experience, or how well “understood” the language used may be. Individuals are often unable to even communicate knowledge to themselves. Does knowledge exist if it cannot be communicated? Is anything conceivable, “knowable?” Does there exist anything “unknowable,” or “knowable?”Nothing can be known for certain, but things may be known with very high probability. Humans do not act rationally! Do humans actually operate on any rational basis at all? Is there meaning in assigning meaning or reason to anything? The “real is rational.” Hegel. False argument that evolution “acts with intent.”What is rationality? Following logical steps– either in self interest, or ethical interest. Rationality may be linked to achieving a specific goal– to behave efficiently. “Rationality” in fact implies intent to natural processes– evolution is not “rational,” because it does not have intent. Rationality as distinct from logic. Rationality may be based on logic– but is logic inherent? Is logic non-relative knowledge? That was the first question of the meeting!“All of philosophy is wrong and you are right,” Schröedinger was a dumbass.",

"content" : "Who Deserves to be Flooded?  The question is interpreted very literally. For the literal interpretation: Florida, Russia, Great Britain. Flooding in Pakistan, hurricanes in Puerto Rico. First world nations (esp. The US) largely responsible for conditions killing great numbers in developing countries– both through contributions to climate change (Pakistan) and through abuses under imperialistic rule (PR).  Climate accelerationism met with strong objections and nervous laughter. Colonial history in Pakistan and how developing countries suffer for 70-year-old emissions from the Global North– China’s emissions are the result of its ravaging by the West and subsequent rapid industrialization. Middle Eastern countries have the greatest emissions per capita. The economic value of oil– how it’s destroyed the Middle East and saved the Nords. Nationalization in Europe and Latin America. Ozone depletion and recovery over three decades. Exxon Mobile– formally the world’s largest company, but growing increasingly less powerful.  “Not to sound like a fucking Liberal, but if you watch John Oliver–” ‘carbon offsets’ largely snake oils. Tesla and its contributions to alternative energy– can state subsidized environmental protections have any effect? Technology needed for alternative energy manufacture also extremely environmentally taxing– back to Venezuela, lithium needed for electric car batteries largely mined in Latin America. Yet electric cars may still be better for the environment.  Many countries need oil and other environmentally taxing measures to maintain their economies, especially in the developing world. Should developed countries “claim” important environmental resources (e.g. the Amazon) in developing countries to protect it? Shareholders don’t care about climate change! “Green capitalism” is ultimately non-functional. Is capitalism the source, or the electoral system? Multi-partisan, or no parties (George Washington!)?",

"content" : "Separation of Art and Artist  The “separation of art and artist” is an academic concept that has been debated for decades and, arguably, longer. Consider, for example, the preservation of ancient texts by scholars such as Aristotle, work which was for centuries done in an almost exclusively religious context. The monks tasked with transcribing the works of the Great Philosopher would have acknowledged him as a pagan or, worse, an atheist– yet he was known as the Great Philosopher nonetheless. In more modern history, famous playwright Oscar Wilde was arrested on charges of homosexuality, yet maintained massive popularity well into the contemporary era.  Yet it was not until the 20th century that critics began to move away from traditional literary criticism, which emphasized historical context and authorial circumstances in interpretation, to “death of the author,” which posited that literature (and, later, other forms of art) should be interpreted only from its end point: the final consumer decides the meaning of a work, regardless of authorial intention. The relationship between art and artist which had been historically almost unquestioned grew increasingly distal in the eyes of critics. Death of the author saw increasing popularity as academia grew more critical of the underrepresentation of authors of color and women authors within the Western canon.  With the advent of social media, authors have become increasingly visible in the public eye. No longer are viewers restricted in their understanding by the 24-hour news cycle– they may discover a creator’s thoughts, words, and misdeeds in real time. Not only this, but they may take matters of criticism into their own hands, not needing to wait for the weeks or months it may take to publish an editorial or mail a letter, but message a creator directly through websites such as Twitter and Facebook.  As the public grows increasingly cognizant of an artist’s indiscretions, some have asked the morality in engaging with art by those unfavored within the public eye. Still others have argued for the separation of art and artist– that art may be engaged without considering, or even actively rejecting, its creator’s influence.  One must distinguish between interpretation and enjoyment, though both are equally related to the issue of art and artist: interpretation refers to one’s understanding of a work, what is gleaned, its message and meaning, while enjoyment refers simply to the pleasures a work of art may evoke. Should an artist’s questionable words or actions sour either? Some argue that, as learning new information about an author changes nothing intrinsically about their existing work, only enjoyment– which is purely intrinsic to the reader– will diminish when an author is found “problematic.”  However, not all subscribe to the author’s critical death– to many, art and artist are considered inseparable. The traditional theory of literary criticism remains popular. Art is, in many ways, a reflection of its artist. What thoughts, emotions, and actions had occurred within and around the artist exist also in their work. Take, for example, the work of H.P. Lovecraft, a phenomenal racist. His work centers around a fear of the strange of the unknown and, even within his work, is often closely linked with a fear of people of color– for example, by characterizing Native peoples as worshiping or abetting the eldritch gods. Despite the wild popularity of Lovecraft’s stories, his hatred of people of color is indivisible from the themes of his work.  One may also argue that, for as much as an artist’s emotions may affect their work, many creators avoid or even contradict their actions outside of their art. John Lennon of Beatles fame was a wifebeater and child abuser, yet his song Imagine was performed by celebrities such as Gal Godot as recently as the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in a call for unity and kindness, and even by Lennon’s son after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.  With this in mind, one must consider the circumstances created by the entertainment industry and how many creators experience abuse throughout their careers. Should one have sympathy for the interpersonal conflicts of creators and celebrities, considering what abuses they may have faced, and how they experience constant scrutiny within the public eye?  Here we reach into the issue of consumption under capitalism: with the entertainment industry so corrupt, and so much art controlled by corporations such as Disney and Netflix, how much responsibility do individuals retain in the creation of and engagement with art? Does morality of consumption start and end with the material benefit wrought by faulty parties as this consumption occurs?  The issue of morality within creative consumption is a topic of debate perhaps as old as the written language, as works criticizing politically powerful entities have been constantly under fire. Whether art may be separated from its creator is intrinsic to this understanding of morality as, consistently, the desire to distinguish the two comes from an impression of moral conflict. On this subject matter, one may consider the opinions expressed by Oscar Wilde as he was attacked for homosexual themes in his work: to judge art not by its beauty, but by its moral merits, is a form of criticism for “brutes and illiterates.”",

"content" : "Philosophy of Language  There exists a question as to what constitutes a “language.” Certainly some “languages” are obvious– this text is written in a language, and the discussion it describes was spoken in a language. This raises problems of medium– is language not restricted to speech or text?– of origin– are synthetic languages, “conlangs,” languages in the same sense as natural languages?– and of recipient– what might we call code, the language of computers? One may argue, from these examples, that a “language” is something constituted of “words” that communicate “meaning.”  Regardless of a language’s medium, origin, or recipient, the problem of meaning is constant. The philosophy of language is largely concerned with the communication of meaning, in particular, the explanation of what exists. Readers of philosophical texts will understand why this poses such an issue– even “approachable” philosophical texts will pose difficulty in their comprehension, by virtue of attempting to explain a concept so complex and abstract. This forces either the adoption of fiction (to quote Ursula K. Le Guin, “All fiction is metaphor… a metaphor for what? If I could have said it non-metaphorically, I would not have written all these words…”) or the creation of extremely dense non-fiction texts. The former may be more fun to read, but is more prone to misunderstanding, or even the erasure of meaning entirely. The latter is very often a chore: a textbook, consisting not of bland, factual statements (“the dipole moment describes the asymmetrical movement of electrons across a molecule…”) but instead sentences that are stupendous, insane, and false.  The density and complexity of these texts spark debate as to the usefulness of language and language in its current state. Some argue about the “inaccessibility” of jargon– they claim that meaning could be more easily communicated in more simple, less specialized language. By these arguments, the onus for comprehension lies in the author’s word choice, their preference for words with more or fewer syllables, the latter choice always better, the former the tool only of masturbatory elites. There is some evidence of this– Latin, in many ways a “timeless” language, lost much of its complexity as Europe aged beyond the Roman empire. Regional dialects became “vulgar,” simplifying verbs and nouns as its speakers forgot or simply ceased to care about the minutiae (pronounced min-oo-ti-eye) of the language. Almost no modern Romance language retained all ten noun cases– forgotten were the four infinitives– no longer do we see the second person-plural-pluperfect-passive-subjunctive conjugation in Spanish or Italian or French. People simply do not retain language with rules that seem arcane.  Yet how do we communicate meaning without jargon? How is the chemist to explain their field if, rather than use the word “electronegativity,” they must say explicitly “the tendency for an atom to attract electrons?” How should the small business manager explain his success to his investors if, rather than saying “profit,” he need state “the difference between the money spent creating and vending products and the money given in exchange for the product sold?” How might the linguist describe the language she studies if, rather than “verb,” she must say “the part of a lingual idea which describes an action, as opposed to an object or actor?”  We return to the question of how meaning is communicated, when language, as demonstrated, is so inherently flawed. Ludwig Wittgenstein argues in his Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus that the world consists not of objects, but facts (objects consisting not of matter, but logical arguments). To take this abstractly, that at least the way in which we interact with the world is dependent on our understanding of true and false clauses, one must ask how truth is communicated, and, from there, how one can understand a statement as true. From these questions we reveal that words carry no inherent meaning– if I say “the sky is blue,” but your understanding of “sky” is my understanding of “ground,” then my statement is, to you, false, and truth improperly communicated. This state of affairs– one we encounter every time we argue with a friend, or a teacher, or our parents, every time we try to articulate the gravity of an externally mundane experience– is tremendously lonely. We cannot escape language, even though, as Wittgenstein claimed, “whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.”",

"content" : "PROLOGUE  Regarding the title of his famous novel, Il nomme della rosa, author Umberto Eco said he preferred a title with the least information possible. In the style of Charlotte Brontë’s Jane Eyre, or Arthur Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes, it was Eco’s hope to name the novel “Adso da Melk,” after its protagonist. In the same style, I’d prefer to title these entries only after the dates on which they were written. Unfortunately, Eco was pressured by his publisher to rename his novel (in English: The Name of the Rose) as titles after the protagonist were unpopular in the Italian industry. In the same style, I’m forced to properly name these entries.  Our first meeting of the semester is in the days prior to Mega Fair, and turns up most of its usual actors:DRAMATIS PERSONAENishan Amgain (Club President): A Senior of PhysicsAisulu “Ais” Murzagulova (Vice President): A Senior of Quantitative EconomicsConnor Owens (Social Media Chair/PR): A Senior of Computer ScienceCatarina Palmer (Myself; the Secretary): A Sophomore of BiochemistryEvan Burke (Treasurer): A Sophomore of Biology and NeuroscienceEmil Sayahi (IT): A Sophomore of Computer ScienceGrant McCrary (Events Coordinator): A Sophomore of Political ScienceAriana Noas (Just Here to Hang Out): A Junior of Social Work  By the time I completed this list, it was 8:50PM.  We did manage to discuss, at relative length, intentions to expand club activities over the coming semesters. As nearly all of our membership intends to graduate this year, the accruement of new members is a must. Our plans are to coordinate with other clubs, particularly religious and cultural organizations on campus. Emil is compared to a video game character; Ais attempts to teach me the pronunciation of her surname. Nishan, finally, addresses the topics we intend to discuss this semester. No conclusions were reached, though many were broached.",
